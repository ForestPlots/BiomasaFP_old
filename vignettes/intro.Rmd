**Introduction**

The BiomasaFP R package is designed to allow ForestPlots.net users to calculate above-ground biomass (AGB), stem density, wood mass density estimates and frequency and number of species by family from data downloaded from the [Forest Plots database] [http://www.forestplots.net/]. It also provides functions to clean your data, and calculate Plot View level summary statistics.  

---

**Input data **

Three files, downloaded from ForestPlots.net, are needed as input data:  a) Individuals csv file from the Advanced Search, b) Wood density file  from the query library and c) Plot View metadata file from the query library. The 3 files should correspond to the same Plot Views.

These files are read into R using `mergefp`, which then merges them and performs some basic cleaning:

```
library(BiomasaFP)
# reads, cleans and merges the Census data file, metadata file and wd file.
mergedCensus <- mergefp('TestDataset.csv','Metadata10nov.csv','wd10nov.csv' )
```

`mergefp` can also be used to merge and clean these three datasets when the have already been read into R. `mergefp` automatically checks whether each argument passed to it is a `data.frame` object, so you **do not** need to specify whether your arguments are dataframes or file paths. The dataset returned by `mergefp` is used as input in many of the other functions in *BiomasaFP*.

**Producing summary statistics**

Once you have obtained your merged dataset using `mergefp`, you can calculate a number of summary statistics at Plot View level:  
- Geographic coordinate, dates of the first and last census, and number of censuses (`SummaryPlotviews`).
- The number of species and individuals in each family (`SummaryFamilies`).
- Total AGB in each census (`SummaryAGB`).
- Change in AGB between the first and last census (`AGBch`).
- Census interval weighted mean AGB (`MeanWtAGB`).    

These functions return dataframes indexed by Plot View ID (and Census number, where summary statistics are calculated for each census).

The three functions that calculate AGB summary statistics (`SummaryAGB`,`AGBch` and `MeanWtAGB`) require an equation to estimate AGB from tree diameter to be specified. 7 allometric equations are included in *BiomasaFP*; 6 equations from Chave et al. 2005 (`AGBChv05DH`, `AGBChv05M`,`AGBChv05MH`,`AGBChv05W`,`AGBChv05WH`) and the Chave et al. (2014) pantropical model (model 4, 'AGBChv14'). Where tree height is used in an equation, it is estimated using regional parameters  for a Weibull model (Feldpaush et al., 2011). 

```
#Estimate total AGB per Plot View in each census
#Used Chave 2005 moist forest equation without height
AGB.sum<-SummaryAGB(mergedCensus,AGBChv05M)
head(AGB.sum)
#Repeat using Chave 2005 moist forest equation with height
AGB.sum.height<-SummaryAGB(mergedCensus,AGBChv05MH)
head(AGB.sum.height)
```

By default, these three functions use DBH4 for tree diameters, but this can be set by the user to be any one of DBH1, DBH2, DBH3 and DBH4.

```
#Default, uses DBH4
AGB.mean<-MeanWtAGB(mergedCensus,AGBChv05M)
head(AGB.mean)
#Use DBH3 instead
AGB.mean.dbh3<-MeanWtAGB(mergedCensus,AGBChv05M,"DBH3")
head(AGB.mean.dbh3)
```

**Estimating tree level AGB**

The allometric equations called by `SummaryAGB`,`AGBch` and `MeanWtAGB` can also be accessed individually, and return estimates of AGB and (where height is used in the equation) height for each tree in each census. Again, these use DBH4 by default, but this can be changed by the user.In addition to estimating tree level AGB, the allometric equation functions call the helper function `CleaningCensusInfo`, which performs additional data cleaning, including adding a column with whether a tree is dead/ snapped (binary, 1 if dead/ snapped, 0 otherwise) and a column with the diameter of a tree in the census before it died. These outputs are returned as part of the output from the allometric equation functions.


```
#Use DBH4 (default)
tree.AGB<-AGBChv05M(mergedCensus)
head(tree.AGB)
#Use DBH3
tree.AGB.dbh3<-AGBChv05M(mergedCensus,"DBH3")
head(tree.AGB.dbh3)
```
